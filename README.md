# Practice-It Answers

Created by Gideon Tong. Code is mostly original, any copied code is given credit where credit is due. Practice-It is an online practice and problems website for programming in Java and JavaScript, created by the University of Washington. Used in several college courses and high school classes, it is a "useful" (some may disagree) tool to determining how much information was retained in lectures. Thus, as many coding problems require semi-original solutions, I've decided to post my own solutions, and if you think you've thought of a more efficient solution, I welcome you to submit a pull request!

This is a *work in progress*. Not all answers are completed yet.
